Project: 'Weather App' using React
Category: 'Weekend Project'


Use:
        Once app is running via 'npm start'

        You will be able to search a town/city via the 'Search-bar' in the
        upper left hand corner of the site. If you are searching for a town/city
        which exists in multiple countries you can specify the name of the town/city
        followed by that of the abbreviated country to reach the correct location
            Ex: Cambridge, US vs Cambridge

        -Once a location is entered the user will see the name of the specified
        city followed by the country.

        -Listed beneath this will be day/date/month/year
          i.e. Monday 12 January 2020

        -Next will be the current temperature read out in Celsius
          Depending on the temperature of the specified location, the background
          will change from a default of a "cold" background to that of a "warm"
          background.

        -Lastly, will be the current weather conditions
          Ex:
              -Rain
              -Sunny
              -Windy



Object:
        Become more familiar with developing React Apps, used syntax, structure and various components.
        With this project specifically, my aim was to work with a fairly common API, for this project
        I had used the 'Open Weather Map API' which calls to a Restful API to return current weather conditions.

        This project also uses Js Fetch API along with React Hooks and conditionals.
        With this project, I am also further establishing my understanding of Css, Js, and HTML.


Notes:
       This project is stepping stone, in my journey to expose myself to new technologies, frameworks, and practices. As I progress, I plan to implement varying concepts and functionality into future projects to build upon this developing knowledge base.

       In addition to familiarizing myself with the aforementioned skills, I am utilizing git with each project to develop a stronger understanding of Version Control, Github, and the respective command line prompts needed.
